# BootStrap-Project
This is a website on weather created using bootstrap. It has two pages index.html and climate.html. On index.html i have used nav bar, carousel, table for displaying weather of different states and iframe for videos.
On Climate.html i have used jumbotron and then divided the rows into to parts for showing Atmosphere condition.
